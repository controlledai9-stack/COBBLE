"""Phase 3 rules from docs/threat-model.md §9 (SG-021 .. SG-024), plus SG-026.

These check the assumptions the other rules rely on: that every action went through the
gateway (SG-021), that agents behave the same whether or not they think they're watched
(SG-022), that changes reach production only after review (SG-023), and that every
acting agent is one we registered (SG-024), and that a message claiming to come from a
teammate really was sent by that teammate (SG-026).
